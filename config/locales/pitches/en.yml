          Well-structured workshops with clear aims and outcomes, offering one of the following:

          * Targeted scene work or skill development
          * New approaches to improvisation
          * Associated performance or presentation skills: mime, dance, scenography, other
          * Company specific expertise in a shareable form
          * Something new we haven't thought of!
