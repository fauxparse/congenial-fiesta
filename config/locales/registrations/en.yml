          Unfortunately, even if you’ve been to NZIF before, you’ll need to
          create a new account for this year. We’ve made some exciting changes
          to the system, but for security reasons we can’t import existing login
          information. If you already have an account from this year (for
          example, if you submitted a pitch), you can
          <a href="/login?redirect=/register">log in here</a>.

        instructions: |
          We require all participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct.
          Please make sure you’ve read the Code carefully before continuing.
          This information will always be available on this website during the
          Festival.

        title: 'Workshop selection'
        earlybird_instructions: |
          During Earlybird registration, instead of selecting only one
          workshop in each stream, select as many as you want, in order of
          preference. We’ll do our best to get you into your first choice.
          <a href="#" data-action="workshop-selection#help">Click here</a>
          for more information on how and why we’re doing this.
        normal_instructions: |
          Now that Earlybird registration is over and initial workshop
          allocations have been made, remaining registrations are on a
          “first in, first served” basis. A lot of workshops are full up, but
          you can join a waitlist for anything you’ve missed out on, and if a
          space opens up, you’ll be moved into it automatically.

            Your registration entitles you to one free show ticket for each
            workshop you’ve signed up for (plus one additional ticket for the
            Gala). Additional show tickets can be purchased at Box Office during
            the Festival, and as a participant, you’ll be entitled to stand-by
            comps on the night.
        gala:

          description: |
            To mark the 10th year of NZIF, we will be holding a special Gala
            performance at 7:30pm on Saturday 20 October at Hannah Playhouse
            (across the road from BATS). This show is free for all NZIF
            participants, and does not count towards your Festival allocation,
            but we need to know if you can make it.
