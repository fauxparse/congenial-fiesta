          During Earlybird registration, instead of selecting only one
          workshop in each stream, select as many as you want, in order of
          preference. We’ll do our best to get you into your first choice.

            Your registration entitles you to one free show ticket for each
            workshop you’ve signed up for (plus one additional ticket for the
            Gala). Additional show tickets can be purchased at Box Office during
            the Festival, and as a participant, you’ll be entitled to stand-by
            comps on the night.

            To mark the 10th year of NZIF, we will be holding a special Gala
            performance on Saturday 20 October at Hannah Playhouse (across the
            road from BATS). This show is free for all NZIF participants, and
            does not count towards your Festival allocation, but we need to
            know if you can make it.
