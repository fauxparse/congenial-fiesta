      Earlybird Registration
    %p
      Last year, some workshops sold out in a matter of hours,
      before some of you were even awake.
    %p
      We want to make things fairer this year.

    %p
      Until #{l registration_form.registration.festival.earlybird_cutoff.to_date, format: :same_year},
      rather than first-in, first-served, we‚Äôll collect your
      order of preference for the workshops you‚Äôre interested in.
    %p
      Then our software will fill in workshop lists using those preferences,
      attempting to give everybody their first choices where possible.

    %p
      This means that if a workshop sells out quickly, we have the information
      we need to give our earlybirds the royal treatment, like
      putting you on a waitlist for your top choice, or running more workshops
      where popular choices have sold out quickly.
    %p
      This isn‚Äôt information we‚Äôve been able to collect before!

      Try it now! Click on the buttons in the order you want to select them.
    %p
      To change the order, simply click on a selected button to deselect it.
      The others will be bumped up the list.

    %p
      We know it‚Äôs a bit more complicated, but we think it‚Äôs a much fairer way
      to make sure everyone gets the best out of their Festival.
